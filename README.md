# ngx-oxford

ngx-oxford takes the busy-work out of dealing with rendering comma-separated lists in
[Angular](https://angular.io/).

You can use ngx-oxford as a pipe or component, and there are plenty of options.

## Demo

Run `ng serve demo` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if
you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
